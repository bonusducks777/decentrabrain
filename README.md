# DecentraBrain

**A decentralized marketplace for reusable, monetizable robot "brains" built on Olas for the Encode Hackathon 2025**

![Slide 4](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jeeUkYEjfwKp9jdXKI6pCYoCHRy6uAv_)

DecentraBrain is a platform that enables developers to create, monetize, and rent modular AI "brains" for robots, simplifying autonomous robot development and testing. Built for the [Olas Encode Hackathon](https://hackathon.olas.network), our project leverages the Olas Mech Marketplace and SDK to empower developers and users with flexible, agentic robot control logic. Our vision is to create a vibrant ecosystem where creators monetize high-quality brains, and users rent them for robotics applications like prototyping, education, and robot-as-a-service deployments.

## What We Built
![Slide 8](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hnCYyRr6DfMIncdDjeK3iyfAhigUDIv8)

We developed a robot-coordinator agent and a custom Mech to demonstrate a modular "brain" stack, integrated with the Olas ecosystem. Key components include:

![Slide 9](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-iPG8iZwTCs1YTeNDdiaQTPUyyBKZY1Y)


- **Mech Marketplace - Demand Side (Bounty 1)**:
  - Integrated the existing `openai_request` Mech to process user commands (e.g., "Navigate to kitchen") using OpenAIâ€™s API for natural language interpretation.
  - Used `mech_client` to call the Mech within our coordinator agent, enabling modular logic swapping.
  - Demonstrated real-world applicability by outsourcing command processing to the Mech.

- **Mech Marketplace - Supply Side (Bounty 2)**:
  - Created and deployed `RobotControlMech` (Component ID 285, Agent ID 63, Service ID 46 on Ethereum).
  - Interprets structured natural language commands and interfaces with robots to enact movements.
  - Deployed on Ethereum, incurring $60 in gas fees due to Gnosis chain issues.
  - Minted on the Olas Registry with hashes:
    - Component: `bafybeigbewxptjjhzpxq36bhh46h2knlh5bnarqf24g6m2pjwdqnx3o7wi`
    - Agent: `bafybeig76z7jdxs7kc5ztblkzpkzhzt4ufmbjucphtmba22o72fr3lghuq`
    - Service: `bafybeihf3awmfwyvnzidlwtfecttdluun4pz7lzcggrijolw5vrhjd7aqm`

- **Agent Integration via Olas SDK (Bounty 3)**:
  - Built a Python-based robot-coordinator agent using the Olas SDK (`mech-tools-dev` template).
  - Logic flow: Interpret user command â†’ Forward to `openai_request` Mech â†’ Pass results to `RobotControlMech` for robot actuation.
  - Ready to go on the Olas Registry (olas-side problems prevented this), interacting with staking contracts for rewards.
  - Packaged as a modular "brain" for future Robot Operating System (ROS) compatibility.

- **Frontend**:
  - Developed a user-friendly interface using Flask and Tailwind CSS, integrated with `mech_client`.
  - Features:
    - Input fields for commands, tool (`coordinator-service`), and chain config (`gnosis` or `ethereum`).
    - Real-time display of Mech responses, parsed commands, and logs.
    - Error handling for offline Mechs or misconfigurations, ensuring UI accessibility.
  - Simplifies brain usage for non-technical users, enhancing UX.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**:
  - **Python 3.10**: Core logic for the coordinator agent and Mech interactions.
  - **Flask**: Web framework for the frontend server.
  - **Olas SDK**: For agent development and registry integration.
  - **mech_client**: Library for interacting with Mech Marketplace (Demand and Supply Side).
  - **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management.
  - **requests**: HTTP requests for Mech interactions.

- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: UI structure and interactivity.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Responsive, modern styling via CDN.
  - **Jinja2**: Templating for Flask.

- **Blockchain**:
  - **Ethereum**: Deployed `RobotControlMech` and registered agent/service.
  - **Gnosis Chain**: Targeted for lower fees, but fallback to Ethereum due to issues.
  - **Olas Registry**: Minted component, agent, and service.

- **Environment**:
  - `.env` file for `WALLET_ADDRESS`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `RPC_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Hackathon Challenges & Solutions

We faced several issues during the 48-hour hackathon, mitigated as follows:
- **Mech Client Issues**: All teams reported problems with `mech_client`. We ran payload agent scripts locally to verify functionality, meeting bounty requirements.
- **run_service.sh Failure**: The Olas quickstart script failed to run our custom Mech post-deployment. We validated locally to ensure correctness.
- **Autonomy Fetch Issues**: Vague instructions for fetching services led to errors. We used local deployment workflows to bypass.
- **Wallet Key Reading**: Mech quickstart failed to read wallet keys. We hardcoded keys locally for testing (not recommended for production).
- **Gas Fees**: Spent $60 on Ethereum deployment due to Gnosis chain instability.

Despite these challenges, we successfully deployed `RobotControlMech`, integrated `openai_request`, and built a functional frontend, achieving 10+ local interactions to demonstrate usage.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/decentrabrain.git
   cd decentrabrain
   ```

2. **Create Templates Folder**:
   ```bash
   mkdir templates
   ```
   - Place `index.html` in `templates/`.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask mech-client python-dotenv requests
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create `.env` in the project root:
   ```env
   RPC_URL=https://rpc.gnosischain.com
   WALLET_ADDRESS=0xYourWalletAddress
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python robotcontrol_frontend.py
   ```
   - Access at `http://localhost:5001`.

## Hackathon Alignment

Our project aligns with Olasâ€™ bounties by:
- **Impact**: Pioneering a marketplace for robot brains, driving Olas ecosystem adoption.[](https://www.bee.com/38875.html)
- **Technical Execution**: Robust Mech and agent integration despite infrastructure challenges.
- **Alignment**: Leverages `mech_client`, Olas SDK, and Registry for a modular stack.
- **User Experience**: Intuitive frontend simplifies brain usage for all users.
